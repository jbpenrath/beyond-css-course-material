# Map challenge

For this challenge, the only changes you will make will be within the mixin itself.

- [x] First, check if the value is in the map, and if it is, we can use that.
      This is like what we saw in the previous lessons.
- [x] If it is NOT in the map, we want to check if the value is a number or not.
- [x] If it is a number, we can use that number.
- [x] And to step it up even more, when we check if that value is a number,
      we can also look to see if itâ€™s unitless or not.
- [x] If it is a number, but has no unit,
      we can print an error saying what the issue is.
- [ ] Otherwise, we can print an error saying that the value is not in the map,
      or a unit with a number.
